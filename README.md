Project: Cross-Platform Shared Music Queue
Author: Joseph Jia

This project aims to create a shared music queue that can support cross-platform between Spotify and Apple Music users.
The queue will be played by the host of the party, who can select to use Spotify or Apple Music.
Everyone else who joins the party (via a QR code or party code) can add songs to the queue.
